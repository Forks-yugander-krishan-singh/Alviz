## Getting Started
Instructions on how to get this project running on your local machine

### Prerequisite
```
A simple webserver which can host static files (Apache, IIS, NodeJS, Express, SimpleHTTPServer, etc.)  
```

### Example
If you have python installed,  there's a simple built-in webserver which you can use.
Run the following command in the project's root directory.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

From here, the application will be served in `http://localhost:8000`
